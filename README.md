# 7-11-Game
A java single player game with computer opponents, similar to Uno but with unique rules.

Currently the cards in play are the typical 'uno' cards, 4 colors and 10 numbers, but special cards will be added in the future.

To win the game you need to place your cards before the computers can place all of theirs. The rules are different for the user, 
as they start with less cards, but must draw cards if they cannot play. Computers start with 11 cards but simply skip thier turn 
if they cannot play.
